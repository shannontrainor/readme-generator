# ReadMe Generator

## Description
AS A developer
I WANT a README generator
SO THAT I can easily put together a good README for a new project

## Usage
This ReadMe Generator was developed to provide a user with a ReadMe for their repo. The user will be prompted to answer questions via their terminal. Prompts include questions like: what the title of their project is, what it is used for, how to test it, and contact information. Some questions require input, while others have default answers, or a list for the user to choose from. Once the questions are completed, a ReadMe.md file is generated containing the information the user provided. The ReadMe Generator was created to practice Node & ES6
